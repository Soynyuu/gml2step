## About this tool

gml2step is a **Python library & command-line tool** for converting CityGML to STEP (ISO 10303-21). It provides both a Python API and CLI interface, allowing you to choose the best approach for your workflow.

## What you can achieve

The **world's first** open-source CityGML → STEP conversion implementation makes Japan's [PLATEAU](https://www.mlit.go.jp/plateau/) 3D city models **editable in standard CAD software**. Transform "view-only" PLATEAU data into fully editable models in your CAD/BIM environment.

### Use cases

- **Architectural design**: Import PLATEAU building data into CAD for renovation planning and urban development projects
- **3D printing**: Adjust and optimize building models in CAD to create printable data
- **Simulation & analysis**: Feed models into CAD/CAE tools for structural, thermal, or acoustic simulation
- **Customization**: Use real-world building data as a foundation for design modifications and extensions

## Quick example

```bash
# Parse and summarize
gml2step parse ./building.gml

# Convert to STEP (open in CAD)
gml2step convert ./building.gml ./output.step --method auto

# Extract 2D footprints
gml2step extract-footprints ./building.gml --output-json ./fp.json
```

```python
from gml2step import convert, parse, stream_parse, extract_footprints

# Lightweight summary (no OCCT needed)
summary = parse("building.gml")

# Stream buildings one at a time
for building, xlinks in stream_parse("building.gml"):
    process(building)

# Convert to STEP (editable in CAD)
ok, msg = convert("building.gml", "output.step", method="auto")
```
