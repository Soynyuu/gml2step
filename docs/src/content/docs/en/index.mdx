import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## What it does

gml2step reads CityGML 2.0 files and produces STEP (ISO 10303-21) files suitable for CAD/CAM/BIM software. It handles Japan's [PLATEAU](https://www.mlit.go.jp/plateau/) large-scale 3D city model datasets out of the box.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Parse" icon="document">
    Stream-parse CityGML files of any size with constant memory usage. Extract building metadata, footprints, and geometry without loading the entire DOM.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Convert" icon="setting">
    Transform 3D building geometry to STEP via OpenCASCADE. Four conversion methods with automatic LoD fallback and progressive geometry repair.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fetch" icon="magnifier">
    Download CityGML data from PLATEAU's public API by address or mesh code. Geocoding, ranking, and caching included.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Extract" icon="list-format">
    Pull 2D footprints with height estimates from CityGML — no OCCT dependency required.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick example

```bash
# Parse and summarize
gml2step parse ./building.gml

# Convert to STEP
gml2step convert ./building.gml ./output.step --method auto

# Extract 2D footprints
gml2step extract-footprints ./building.gml --output-json ./fp.json
```

```python
from gml2step import convert, parse, stream_parse, extract_footprints

# Lightweight summary (no OCCT needed)
summary = parse("building.gml")

# Stream buildings one at a time
for building, xlinks in stream_parse("building.gml"):
    process(building)

# Full conversion
ok, msg = convert("building.gml", "output.step", method="auto")
```
